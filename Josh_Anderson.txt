About Me:
	I grew up west of Missoula, out in Frenchtown. After high school I joined the Army, did four years of service.
Spent most of my time in Germany before getting sent to north carolina. Once getting out I went to school at Life university and played rugby. 
While there I had a teacher who turned me on to computer science. I decided to move back and get my Computer Science degree.
