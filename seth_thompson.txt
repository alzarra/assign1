About me:

I am originally from Oregon. I have lived in many different cities and states throughout the Pacific NorthWest. I graduated from Corvallis High School in 2004. I have mainly worked in restaurants and bars. I have a passion for creating new and creative food and drinks. I am currently a bartender working to pay for school. After high school I worked at a few different restaurants, first as a cook and then to management and eventually owned my own restaurants with a business partner in Idaho. I have also always had a love for math and after spending 2 years growing my business with my partner, working 100 hour work weeks, I decided to sell my portion out to him and follow my other dream of math. Originally as a math major, I was looking into a a minor in computer science and eventually fell for the creativity allowed in programming and eventually switched my major to CS and my minor to math. And here I am now.

** The schedule above is for class and then work respectively after the forward slash. Unfortunately
** my job requires me to be available outside of my set schedule which is Sun and Mon from
** 3:45-8:00 booth days. So the TBAâ€™s are reserved for weeks when I have to cover for others.
