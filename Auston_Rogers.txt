About me:

I grew up in Missoula, and absolutely love it here. After graduating from Hellgate High School in 2012, 
I started attending the University of Montana, intending to get my Doctoral Degree in Pharmacy. After 
realizing that it wasn't for me, I remembered hearing about Computer Science from a friend of mine. I was hooked immediately.
